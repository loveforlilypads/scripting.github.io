					<div class="divFargoMarkdown"><p>I've been asked to write a piece about the 30th anniversary of the birth of the Macintosh at Flint Center on January 24, 1984. It's quite an honor, a surprising one, because past celebrations of the Mac have been exclusively about the members of the Mac team, and Steve Jobs of course. But things have changed perhaps, and now we can have, hopefully a somewhat more realistic appraisal of the role the Mac played in the evolution of computing, with the benefit of 30 years hindsight.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful day, the culmination of about six months of work by my startup company, Living Videotext, to get a product ready. I had hired my brother and future sister-in-law, to help with the development and rollout. We had a Macintosh in our office, it was a huge secret at the time, but we showed it to our best friends anyway, swearing them to secrecy. I remember my first look at a Macintosh, I knew I was going in to see it, but nothing could prepare me for the surprise, the feeling you get when you look at a baby cat or dog -- this thing is cute and gorgeous and new and filled with potential, and most important it spoke directly to me (and millions of others of course) saying -- use me! </p>

<p>That was the brilliance of the Mac, its gestalt. None of the components stood up to the hype. It had nowhere near enough memory. The screen was tiny, as were the floppy disks. The product came at a time when personal computers were getting hard drives, but the Mac had no ability to expand. It didn't even have cursor keys. The Mac was a statement, that's for sure -- but it wasn't a very <i>usable</i> statement, at least in its first incarnation.</p>

<p>Now that was all fixed, in relatively short order. By 1986 the Mac had arrow keys, a bigger screen, more memory, and most important an expansion capability. Then it was supremely usable, and kicked butt in the market. </p>

<p>My startup, when the Mac came out, made most of its money off IBM PC software. By 1986, with the help of Bill Campbell at Apple, we got Macs for every employee at our growing company, and our board of directors, and the die was cast -- we became a Mac software company. And we got rich from it. No complaints about that. The Mac was berry berry good to me (a dated reference to a fictional character from the 80s on SNL).</p>

<p>But what about the long-term historical perspective of the Mac. There, the verdict is not so good. True, all personal computers to follow were basically copies of the Mac, some good, some not so good. I'm typing this on a Mac running software that is an almost exact clone of the software we shipped in 1986 for the Mac. The ideas were very valid, and have stood the test of time. But it's the missed opportunities caused by the Mac's insistence on being right about everything, even when the Mac was wrong, that caused the fractures in the marketplace that are still visible today in the UI of software, and in the confusion of non-expert users. </p>

<p>Try this out sometime with a friend who is a casual computer user who has a WordPress blog. Ask them to choose a command from a menu, and see which one they choose. There are three menu systems on the screen at the same time! One for the operating system, one for the browser, and one for the web app. This is not simple and not easy to use, and is the result of Apple's proprietary networking, way back in the 80s, that forced the innovation in networking, that was the manifest destiny of personal computers, to route around the closed-off networking protocols of the Macintosh. Had Apple, instead of keeping the right to create networking software for itself almost exclusively, because their APIs were so incomprehensible and contradictory, taken the opposite approach -- that their APIs were not proprietary and could be cloned by other manufacturers freely, and built on by software developers, again, freely, the networks we use today would work in vastly different and imho, much better ways. We'd also be much further along. In many ways, the networking user interfaces we use today are inferior to the ones we used on the Mac in the 80s -- thirty years later! So we haven't even progressed over all that time, we're still struggling to re-invent the basic UI techniques we had working back then. It's a miracle that you can use an outliner in the browser as I am right now, but wait a minute -- we had that working in 1984. If only Steve and Sidhu et al hadn't been so possessive. And if you think I didn't say anything about this at the time, you don't know me very well. <i class="icon-smile"></i></p>

<p>There were a handful of companies that had mastered the Apple networking stack at the time. Reese Jones' Farallon, Andrew Singer's Think Technologies. A pair of developers who made an email app the was bought by Microsoft and became their mail product (the founder of that company, Steve Ullman, was a real visionary). And Don Brown at CE Software with QuickMail. I tried to work with all of them, but it wasn't enough of a critical mass to make a market. I deperately wanted networking for MORE, my outliner. I felt it wasn't complete without it. Had Apple been less restrictive, my career would have been much more interesting. We have the networking today that I wanted then. But it was a long time coming. </p>

<p>The web should have happened on the Mac. We had the best software, the best developers, the best platform, no 640K limit (don't laugh, software on the PC was limited in how far it could grow). We had it all, but the Apple culture wouldn't let us use it.</p>

<p>I love the Mac. I love what it did for me, it gave me a lot of freedom I wouldn't have gotten any other way. However, it stopped short of where it could have gone, and in doing so, I hope serves as a lesson for future generations of technologists. When someone argues for reserving the best stuff for your employees, tell them to stop screwing with your success. As the famous Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki said, Let a thousand flowers bloom. Love the developers and the random chaos the bring to you, and be ready for the love that will flow around your platform. It's the only way that works.</p></div>
